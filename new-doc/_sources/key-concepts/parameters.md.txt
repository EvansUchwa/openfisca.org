# Parameters

A parameter is a numeric property of the legislation which can evolve over time.

Unlike a [variable](./variables.md), a parameter is **not** specific to a specific person or family.

For instance:

* The amount of the *minimum wage*
* The amount of *family allowance per children*
* The *marginal tax scale* used to calculate the income tax

Parameters are used in [formulas](./variables.md#formulas) to calculate variable values.

[Read more about their implementation in OpenFisca](./coding-the-legislation/legislation_parameters.md)
