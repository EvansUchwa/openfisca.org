> This is adapted from our [user taxonomy](https://github.com/openfisca/openfisca-core/wiki/Taxonomie-des-utilisateurs). Prioritisation is made according to the distribution of active users in August 2017, to minimise the risk of targeting an audience where offer is inadequate.


## Conversion funnels

For each type in the [user taxonomy](https://github.com/openfisca/openfisca-core/wiki/Taxonomie-des-utilisateurs), showcase examples of fulfilled **needs**, add an associated CTA to replicate the usage, and suggest **contribution paths**.
