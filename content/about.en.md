## Digital common

OpenFisca is a digital common: it is free and open source software designed, developed and used by many people around the world through democratic, horizontal governance processes such as Requests For Comments (RFCs) and open discussions.

## Community

As contributors to a common, we collectively do our best to make our community a space where everyone can express themselves and feel free to be who they are. Our rules to that end are grown progressively as we learn what works and what doesn't. If you encounter or witness any behaviour in an OpenFisca-related space that does not seem respectful, please open a discussion in the OpenFisca Slack space or [send an email](mailto:contact@openfisca.org?subject=Abuse) to the core team.

## History

The development of OpenFisca began in May 2011 at the French [_Centre d'analyse stratégique_](https://strategie.gouv.fr/) (renamed _France Stratégie_ in April 2013), with the support of the [<abbr title="Institut d'économie publique">IDEP</abbr>](https://www.idep-fr.org/).

OpenFisca was originally developed as a desktop application using the [Qt](http://www.qt.io/) library with a Python API. This source code was released under a free software (AGPL) license in November 2011.

In early 2014, the French Prime Minister task force for open data, [Etalab](https://www.etalab.gouv.fr/), started using OpenFisca and soon became a major contributor. After organising a hackathon to give more visibility to the product, its team decided to:

- stop the development of the [Qt version](https://github.com/openfisca/openfisca-qt);
- separate the computing engine from its desktop user interface;
- offer a web API in addition to the Python API;
- demonstrate the value of the web API by developing sample applications including a web interface to simulate personal cases;
- offer public access to this web API.

The core was improved extensively by [Etalab](https://www.etalab.gouv.fr/), while the French model was being improved and updated by the [<abbr title="Commissariat général à la stratégie et à la prospective">CGSP</abbr>](http://www.strategie.gouv.fr/) with the help of the [<abbr title="Institut d'économie publique">IDEP</abbr>](https://www.idep-fr.org/) and the [<abbr title="Institut des politiques publiques">IPP</abbr>](http://www.ipp.eu/), soon to be joined by the French [State Startups incubator](https://beta.gouv.fr) which used and extended the model for digital public services purposes.

The 2016 <abbr title="OpenGovernment Partnership">OGP</abbr> Paris summit saw a demonstration that a small team could model the base of a tax and benefit system from scratch in under 36 hours, when the [Sénégal](https://github.com/openfisca/openfisca-senegal-ui) income revenue tax was modelled and made usable with a web UI during the OGP hackathon, winning the team the first prize.

This led, in 2017, to a joint effort from Etalab and beta.gouv.fr with a major focus to provide stability, ease of contribution and reusability. This led to the full rewrite of the documentation, the opening of [openfisca.org](https://openfisca.org) to replace openfisca.fr, and the addition of new contributors from other French agencies, as well as international re-users with [Barcelona](https://github.com/jvalduvieco/openfisca-barcelona) joining [Tunisia](https://github.com/openfisca/openfisca-tunisia).
