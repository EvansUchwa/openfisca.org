## Digital common

OpenFisca is a digital common: it is free and open source software designed, developed and used by many people around the world through democratic, horizontal governance processes such as Requests For Comments (RFCs) and open discussions.

## Community

As contributors to a common, we collectively do our best to make our community a space where everyone can express themselves and feel free to be who they are. Our rules to that end are grown progressively as we learn what works and what doesn't. If you encounter or witness any behaviour in an OpenFisca-related space that does not seem respectful, please open a discussion in the OpenFisca Slack space or [send an email](mailto:contact@openfisca.org?subject=Abuse) to the core team.

## History
