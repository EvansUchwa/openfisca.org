### Documentation redesign

You can know check in one site OpenFisca plateform guide and Python API official documentation: [doc.openfisca.org](https://doc.openfisca.org) [[Doc #167](https://github.com/openfisca/openfisca-doc/pull/167)]

### Trace, with parameters!

Web API `/trace` endpoint contains law parameters used by every calculated formula so that, to debug a calculation, you won't need to switch between trace result and legislation explorer anymore. [[Core #765](https://github.com/openfisca/openfisca-core/pull/765)]
