## International

### Documentation redesign

You can now find, all in the same place, the guide to using OpenFisca and the official Python API documentation: [doc.openfisca.org](https://doc.openfisca.org) [[Doc #167](https://github.com/openfisca/openfisca-doc/pull/167)]

### Trace, with parameters!

The Web API `/trace` endpoint now exposes all the rules used calculations. Doubts about that disposable income result? Fear no more! To debug a calculation, now you can just use `/trace`, no need to that awkward switching between your results and the legislation explorer anymore. [[Core #765](https://github.com/openfisca/openfisca-core/pull/765)]

[Demo: Check new /trace!](https://demo.openfisca.org/legislation/swagger#operations-Calculations-trace)

### User research

We can't improve what we dont know. To become better acquainted with the way the community is OpenFisca, and to make OpenFisca more awesome, we're running user interviews. Here is a first [schema](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1-OiVfK0ohxO9qIEJ11gxYKi1_59VJ6oj/view) of our lovely community.  ðŸ™‚


## France

### Improvements to tax calculation

We've improved tax calculation, thanks to a comparison between OpenFisca results and the ones provided by other administrations, like the [DGFiP's 2018 tax simulator](https://www3.impots.gouv.fr/simulateur/calcul_impot/2018/complet/index.htm). [[France #1198](https://github.com/openfisca/openfisca-france/pull/1198)]


Thank you all for these contributions ðŸ™Œ
