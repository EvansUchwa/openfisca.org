## International

### Usage statistics

In the context of our [user research](/en/news/2018-11-14-news), our web site analytics tool Matomo (lauded by France's privacy watchdog CNIL for its RGPD compliance) now consolidates visits to all OpenFisca sites, as open data that you can view here:

## France

### Up-to-the-minute API documentation

You can now browse and search parameters, variables and formulas with all the latest changes, thanks to the new endpoint `/latest`.

In parallel, we are still exposing two stable versions of the API. Endpoint [/v21](https://fr.openfisca.org/api/v21) is slated to be retired shortly ; version [/v24](https://fr.openfisca.org/api/v24) will be tagged with an end-of-life date when we publish a new stable version.

### Updated parameters

The new year has brought the usual bounty of updates to various legislative parameters such as social benefits, minimum wage, etc. With a few exceptions we are up to date with this latest legislation.


Thank you all for these contributions ðŸ™Œ
