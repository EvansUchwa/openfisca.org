## International

New API and changes to Legislation Explorer:

- A [new ‚Äúdemo‚Äù web API"](http://demo.openfisca.org/api) is born! Exposing Country Template instead of France, for your tests

- A [new ‚Äúdemo‚Äù Legislation Explorer for your demonstrations](http://demo.openfisca.org/legislation), that is country independent

- Legislation Explorer tests are now using the Country Template model (legislation-explorer [#201](https://github.com/openfisca/legislation-explorer/pull/201))

- All country entities are now being listed by Legislation Explorer (legislation-explorer [#198](https://github.com/openfisca/legislation-explorer/pull/198))

    Ex: Country Template [household](http://demo.openfisca.org/legislation/household) entity‚Äôs page

- Parameters and variables‚Äô documentations are now available on Legislation Explorer (core [#717](https://github.com/openfisca/openfisca-core/pull/717) and legislation-explorer [#192](https://github.com/openfisca/legislation-explorer/pull/192))

    Ex: Country Template [benefits.housing_allowance](http://demo.openfisca.org/legislation/benefits.housing_allowance) parameter and [housing_allowance](http://demo.openfisca.org/legislation/housing_allowance) variable
